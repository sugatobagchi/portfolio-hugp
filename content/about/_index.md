<p>
Hey there! I'm glad that you could find me! Lately, I've been learning ML and tryna get my hands into OSS softwares and do some meaningful contributions. I am a full-stack developer and recent computer science graduate with a passion for Web and ML technologies. I've led the GDSC SurTech community and actively contribute to the GDG Cloud Kolkata community. I’ve won 5+ hackathons, including 3+ national-level hackathons across India and MLH hackathons. I love sharing knowledge, giving talks, and connecting with innovative minds at meetups!
